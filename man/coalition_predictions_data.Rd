\title{Checks whether coalitions are made of permitted parties.
Permitted parties can be defined either in pv$permparties or in allowed_parties parameter.
Therefore, the idea is first to collect all specified permitted parties in one vector.
This vector will serve as a source for checking whether parties inside the coalitions have valid names.
If there are no parties specified, then the check for valid party names is not performed.}

\item{input}{coalitions to the function.}
